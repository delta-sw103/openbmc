## Overview

Bletchley is a chassis hosting six (6) Mac Mini devices housed in individual
sleds.  Within the chassis is a baseboard containing an AST2600 as a BMC to
provide system management for the entire Bletchley unit.


### BMC Software

The Bletchley BMC will run the [Linux Foundation OpenBMC](https://github.com/openbmc/openbmc)
software.  The software is developed and delivered upstream first and then
integrated into the [Facebook OpenBMC](https://github.com/facebook/openbmc) tree
after it has been accepted upstream.

The primary remote system management interface (API) for the Bletchley BMC is
Redfish.  Command-line APIs may be available, via SSH, for development and debug
purposes but it is not expected that any command-line APIs are used in
production.  As such, all end-to-end feature testing should be based on Redfish
and automated using the upstream [openbmc-test-automation](https://github.com/openbmc/openbmc-test-automation)
repository.
