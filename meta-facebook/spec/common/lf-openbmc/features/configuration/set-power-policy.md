Each managed host shall be able to configure the power policy between:

* Last Power State (default)
* Always On
* Always Off

On DBus this shall be implemented with the
`xyz.openbmc_project.Control.Power.RestorePolicy` interface on a
`/xyz/openbmc_project/control/host{}/power_restore_policy` object for each
host.  On Redfish this should be reflected by the `PowerRestorePolicy` property
on the `/redfish/v1/Systems/{}` end-point.
