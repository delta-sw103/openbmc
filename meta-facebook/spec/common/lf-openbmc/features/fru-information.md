All serialized FRUs that the BMC has access to should be reported on both
DBus and Redfish.  Under DBus there must be a
`xyz.openbmc_project.Inventory.Item` for each, as well as appropriate sub-types
based on the FRU type.

If the FRU contains an EEPROM in a standardized format, such as IPMI, all
fields in the FRU EEPROM must be reported in corresponding
`xyz.openbmc_project.Inventory` interfaces (and similarly reflected in Redfish
properties).

Each FRU EEPROM attached to the BMC should have a debug method to update the
EEPROM.  In most cases this will be performed by a `dd` call to the sysfs
entry for the EEPROM.
