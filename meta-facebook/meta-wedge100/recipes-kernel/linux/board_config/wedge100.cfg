#
# NOTE:
#   - SPI_ASPEED and SPI_ASPEED_USER refer to the same aspeed-spi
#     "user-mode" driver, and it was renamed to SPI_ASPEED_USER since
#     kernel 5.15 to avoid confusion with SPI_ASPEED_SMC driver.
#   - we prefer to compile SPI_ASPEED as modules because it's easier to
#     claim/release the SPI pins at runtime. Refer to spi_util.sh for
#     details.
#
# TODO: the logic in SPI_ASPEED_USER should be moved to SPI_ASPEED_SMC
#       driver.
