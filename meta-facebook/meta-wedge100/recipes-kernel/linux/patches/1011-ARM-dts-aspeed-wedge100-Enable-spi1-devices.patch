Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: aspeed: wedge100: Enable spi1 devices

Summary:

Enable spi1 devices in wedge100 device tree.

Test Plan:

1) "bitbake wedge100-image" succeeded.
2) booted up wedge100 image successfully.
3) spi_util.sh works in wedge100:
   - read backup_bios for twice: the 2 bios.bin files are identical.
   - programed oob_switch_eeprom using the golden image, power cycled
     the chassis: openbmc is sshable. Read back oob_switch_eeprom after
     power cycle: the eeprom.bin is identical to the golden image.
