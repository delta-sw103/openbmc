## Extra content to log to the eMMC device.
##

## Common settings:
## createDirs = off : This prevents rsyslog from creating the directory,
##                    which prevents the entries from being created when
##                    emmc isn't mounted.
## asyncWriting = on : This causes rsyslog to write with a secondary thread,
##                     so if the emmc device were to hang the thread the main
##                     rsyslog process is not affected.
## ioBufferSize = 64k : Increase the internal buffer size to limit writes on
##                      the emmc device.
## flushInterval = .. : Increase the flush interval from a default of 1 second
##                      to limits writes to the device.
